# The following octets define the IP to be assigned to the first server in the list. The remaining servers will receive IPs incremented by 4.
# It should be within the 255.255.255.252 mask and not the first or the last. e.g. 192.168.16.1, 192.168.16.5, 192.168.16.9 and so on.
# It should also be a valid private network IP, such as 10.XX.XX.XX or 192.168.XX.XX 
# Example: IP address 192.168.16.1 should be defined as: oct1 = 192; oct2 = 168; oct3 = 16; oct4 = 1
oct1=172
oct2=24
oct3=3
oct4=3
